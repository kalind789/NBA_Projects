In this project I wanted to look at some NBA Salary data for the upcoming season and see if there was anything interesting in the salary data for teams. 

In particular, I want to see: 
    - Hghest paying teams in the NBA
    - Lowest paying teams in the NBA
    - A boxplot of salaries for the 5 highest paying teams compared to the 5 lowest paying teams
    - If teams that performed worse the season before have a lower salary
    - If there are certain indicators for players (Height, Weight, Position) that lead to higher salaries
    - If teams with higher salaries/taller players have higher betting odds
