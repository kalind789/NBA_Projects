# NBA Game Predictions

In this project I used data from Dataquest as well as their tutorial in order to explore some data mining techniques in a large NBA dataset. Through this experience I was able to understand NBA games not only from a basketball standpoint but also a data standpoint. 

### Beyond the Tutoral
In addition to the steps of the DataQuest tutorial, I have gone on to add complexity of my own. I tried different methods such as trying different models and exploring their impact on accuracy. I also tried techniques such as PCA that allowed for another way to reduce the feature space and in a better way?

### Some of the things I learned through this experience were: 
- Time Series Analysis and how to deal with data that is sequential and how to use past and future data for predicting NBA games. 
- Python syntax, including different pandas techniques that reduce the amount of code I need to write. 
- Using SFS to find the most important features that can greatly reduce row complexity and feature space.
